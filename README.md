# Game of Life Simulation

## Introduction
This Java program is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation. The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input required. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with and visualize the simulation.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Download the source code or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the code using a Java IDE or command line.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
1. Run the compiled program.
2. The GUI window will appear with a grid.
3. Click on the cells to set their initial state (alive or dead).
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation. Click it again to pause.
5. Use the "Reset" button to clear the grid and start over.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- **Graphical Interface**: The program provides a graphical interface using Java's Swing library.
- **Cellular Automaton**: Implements Conway's Game of Life rules for cellular automaton simulation.
- **Start and Pause**: You can start and pause the simulation using the "Start" button.
- **Clear Grid**: The "Reset" button clears the grid and allows you to start a new simulation.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Click and drag the mouse to draw patterns on the grid.

## Controls <a name="controls"></a>
- **Start/Pause**: Click the "Start" button to toggle between starting and pausing the simulation.
- **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the grid and restart the simulation.
- **Drawing**: Click and drag the mouse on the grid to set the initial state of cells.
